# DBMB and the Array


# DBMB had a birthday yesterday. He was gifted an array a
#  of n
#  elements and a number x
# . But there is one problem: he only likes arrays where the sum of the elements equals s
# . To make the array appealing to him, you can perform the following operation any number of times:

# Choose an index i
#  (1≤i≤n
# ) and add x
#  to the number ai
# .
# For example, if he was given the array [1,2,3,5]
#  and x=2
# , you can choose index 3
#  and get the array [1,2,5,5]
# . Your task is to determine whether the array can appeal to DBMB after any number of operations.
# Input
# Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t
#  (1≤t≤1000
# ) — the number of test cases. The following describes the test cases.

# The first line of each test case contains three integers n
# , s
# , x
#  (1≤n,x≤10
# , 1≤s≤100
# ).

# The second line of each test case contains n
#  integers a1,a2,…an
#  (1≤ai≤10
# ) — the elements of the array gifted to DBMB.

# Output
# For each test case, output "YES" if the array can appeal to DBMB. Otherwise, output "NO".

# You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive answer.


# Test cases ki counting
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

    n, s, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    diff = s - sum(a)
    if diff >= 0 and diff % x == 0:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
