# Check Divisibility by Digit Sum and Product

# You are given a positive integer n. Determine whether n is divisible by the sum of the following two values:
# The digit sum of n (the sum of its digits).
# The digit product of n (the product of its digits).
# Return true if n is divisible by this sum; otherwise, return false.


# Example 1:

# Input: n = 99
# Output: true
# Explanation:
# Since 99 is divisible by the sum (9 + 9 = 18) plus product (9 * 9 = 81) of its digits (total 99), the output is true.

# Example 2:

# Input: n = 23
# Output: false
# Explanation:
# Since 23 is not divisible by the sum (2 + 3 = 5) plus product (2 * 3 = 6) of its digits (total 11), the output is false.


class Solution:
    def checkDivisibility(self, n: int) -> bool:
        s = 0
        p = 1
        x = n
        while x > 0:
            x, digit = divmod(x, 10)
            s += digit
            p *= digit
        total = s + p
        # avoid division by zero edge-case (if total = 0) but product will be zero only if one digit = 0,
        # in that case total = s + 0 = s, so total â‰  0 unless s = 0 (i.e. n = 0). For n>0, safe.
        return (n % total) == 0
